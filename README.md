# Reproducible Research - Final Project 

Project submission for Reproducible Research (2400-DS2RR). This repository belongs to Mert Camur and Divij Pherwani. 

## Title of your project

Reusable Report - EDA & Basic Modelling

## Main idea (a few paragraphs)

The project aims to create a reusable report with the same structure of the data. The report will include exploratory data analysis and basic modeling. The report will do the same analysis when the input data is changed. However, input data should be in the same structure as the initial input data.

A test data will be created from initial data and the reusability that is mentioned above will be tested with this data.

The following link is the dataset that is considered for this project: https://www.kaggle.com/ajaypalsinghlo/world-happiness-report-2021

The data includes 149 countries and their region. Also, it includes econometric values for each country.

## Description of the dataset

The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness . The report continues to gain global recognition as governments, organizations and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions. Leading experts across fields – economics, psychology, survey analysis, national statistics, health, public policy and more – describe how measurements of well-being can be used effectively to assess the progress of nations. The reports review the state of happiness in the world today and show how the new science of happiness explains personal and national variations in happiness.

The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll . The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors – economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity – contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world’s lowest national averages for each of the six factors. They have no impact on the total score reported for each country, but they do explain why some countries rank higher than others.

## Report structure

1. Introduction
2. EDA
3. Data Preparation, Pre-processing & Cleaning
4. Modeling 
5. Results & Visualization
6. Summary

The result, visualization and summary will depend on the selected subset of data. It will be automatically modified as per requirement. 

## Automatic report functionalities (if applicable)

Filtering data using slider/input to generate automated analysis and report for required subset of data.
